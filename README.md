Theme: You are a newly added veterenarian at a cat home for the aged shelter, its a place for cats to enjoy thier retirement from catching rats at home.

Tasks:

We are updating the directory of our recidence this year, you will insert or admit a cat, it must be 10 years old above to meet the criteria of a an old cat, if you made a mistake, you can remove it, it's not big deal!
To ensure that the cats are taken care of based on thier age, you need to max heap it so we know whuch cats need our outmost focus. 

DONT WORRY! If you loose track of everything at the end of your shift, just logout or PRESS Five (5) to recap what you've done for today
